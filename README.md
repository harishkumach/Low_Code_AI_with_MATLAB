# Low_Code_AI_with_MATLAB
This repo contains material to introduce basic deep learning concepts using MATLAB

The correct sequence of scripts to go through: 
1. classification_using_mathematical_experssions.mlx  : This script covers the basics of segmenting planes using mathematical experssions and neural networks for classification.
2. training_neural_networks.mlx  : This script covers the process of training a neural network


The file "low_code_ai.pdf" contains the presentation slides which explain the background of the material and contains links to multiple resources.
